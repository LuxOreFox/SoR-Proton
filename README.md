# ⚛ Proton: Vanilla Expansion
Proton is a mod for *Streets of Rogue*, designed to **provide vanilla-style game content** and **improve upon vanilla game elements**.
Its design philosophy is inspired by the *Minecraft* mod "Quark".

For more information, please refer to the [mod wiki](https://github.com/LuxOreFox/SoR-Proton/wiki).

## Notice
>⚠ Proton has not yet been tested for multiplayer gameplay, and multiplayer compatibility is not a current development priority. **Using it in multiplayer mode is not recommended**.

Proton is a BepInEx plugin. It relies on BepInEx as the loader and requires the following plugins to be installed in order to function:
- [RogueLibs](https://github.com/Dzhake/RogueLibs)
- [Neutron](https://github.com/LuxOreFox/SoR-Neutron)
